Adam Art Ananda was born as a scorpion in Hamburg on November 20, 1963.
After completing secondary school, he completed an apprenticeship as a machine fitter. When he was torn from the work process by a spinal disease, which he did not enjoy anyway, he decided to enroll in the master school. At the same time, he began a correspondence course to become a mechanical engineer. Art dropped out of the technician course after the second semester because he had already developed his first program during his studies, with which he could earn a lot of money in a short time.
Out of pure curiosity, Art continued to research in the field of software development and was hired for the first time as a consultant for a large chemical company five years later. Some of the top 500 companies were then his customers for the next few years until the stock market crash in 2000 finally forced him to give up.
Art then moved to Switzerland. There he worked for a few months for an airline and later for a bank. Art studied graphic design and *human-computer-interaction design* in Switzerland. He dropped out of the latter in the third semester because he already knew most of what is taught there from his *graphic design studies* and (at his age) was no longer dependent on a master’s degree.

Art has worked as a tantric masseur for some time, giving sessions in sexological bodywork, teaching tantric massage to people, and giving various other workshops to help people live better, more exciting, and more fulfilling lives.

He is also committed to the implementation of the UBUNTU movement. UBUNTU (“I am because we are”) is an idea for a community in which there is neither money nor exchange nor trade. Everyone does what they want and what they are talented for. He gives his time for the good of the community in which he lives. In return, he'll surely get what he needs from the community.  

Art can often be found in Denmark while kitesurfing, he plays djembe with a few people in Mauerpark in Berlin, creates communities in Portugal, he drove motocross and racing carts, likes to snowboard and sail catamarans. He also prefers to ride a bike than a car around town, constantly trying out new things that he might like.
