# Transition

After I found a solution to be able to create a nice life for myself it's now your turn.  

Ask yourself or ask your higher self these questions from the previous chapter and go for it.  

Now that I have found my soul plan, what also needs to be transformed?
> The whole economy can be transformed. Some people might still think that it's still a good idea to hoard things. Would you like to hoard apples for example?

Of course not. They will become bad after a while. I would rather share them with my friends and neighbors.
> That's what I like to hear.

We have to eat them immediately and they will grow again on it's own.
> Exactly...but some people still hoard money. They don't know that they are living in abundance. 

Yeah, how can we deal with this?
> Don't give them their money. Don't buy their products. Don't use their services and don't borrow money from them. Also don't work so much so that you don't earn so much money and then you don't have to pay that much taxes.

What else can we do?
> One idea is to not work commercial anymore. Create an association instead and give your products and services only to club members. They pay a monthly membership fee or a temporary membership and they will get free product and services from you.

So I am able to also create private club events?
> Of course. For members only. You even don't need a license to do that, because it's not commercial at all. You are not doing this for the money. Instead you are doing this for your members for free. You can also exchange goods between members without asking for money.

You mean we can create a parallel economy in a small circle?
> The circle can also be bigger. Your associating is able to spread across the globe. In these circles one may bake bread. Another one creates furniture and another one is giving massages. All for free. And if you are not writing bills you are not getting money and so you don't have to pay taxes.

Wow, that sounds like a big thing.
> Not big...but easy. How much time do you waist for writing invoices? How much time do you spent for declaring taxes? Now you have got all this time to have free-time.

And the free-time I can use to be creative and think about other ideas how to give something to my community.
> Yep

I am going to dream about this right now. CU later.
