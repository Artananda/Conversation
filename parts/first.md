# My first conversation

I was going into a meditation, walked over a green field and entered my house in the forest to visit my higher self. I opened the door and start to ask my higher self if he likes to write a book with me. I want to know how the mankind or better say how mother earth will survive.
I started to talk in my mother tongue.

Möchtest du mit mir auf Deutsch kommunizieren oder möchtest du mit mir auf Englisch kommunizieren? (Do you want to communicate in German or English)
> English

So I will communicate in English with you.
> Thank you

Some facts about this very special day.
It is Thursday the 28th of January in 2021. I have died excatly 7 years ago. Today is also full moon. The wulfmoon. I only have got 6,- € left for food. The tank of my car is empty so I cannot drive. 
Yesterday was the last day I had internet. I don't know why I am offline, but that does'nt matter. Now I have time to write this book for me and for you.

Sorry bro, that I let you wait.
> Its ok, take your time.

How can I begin?
> Ask me, who I am.

Who are you?
> I am your father.

You mean, you are my physical father?
> No. I am god.

Father is it true, that we will become gods one day?
> Yes

Father is it true, that we are all one?
> Yes

So, every men on this planet is me?
> Yes

So, this includes also women?
> Yes

So, if we hurt someone, we hit our selves?
> Yes, exactly

Why do we have wars. Why do we have fights?
> Because you don't knew that you are all ONE.

How can we stop the fight and the wars?
> Tell the truth

This is what Ghandy found out about all religions...telling the truth is the key.
> Yes

I see that I am doing something like Neal Donald Walsh has done before. Is it ok to do something similar.
> Yes...we will have a different conversation

So, is it about that I am telling the truth?
> You are telling my truth

But your truth is filtered through my perception.
> You will reach the right people. They will feel it. They will feel the truth through shivers in their body.

Do we reincarnate?
> No

So, we are going to nirvana?
> No

Where are we going?
> You will live forever

Did I do something wrong that I have to live forever?
> Are you kidding me?

But our bodies get older.
> Bullshit. I gave you a body that already stopped to get older. You already know about the 7 years where all cells regenerate. So your body is not older than 7 years. Only your mind is getting, lets say wiser.

So, all of us stay young?
> Not that. Some will get older and die.

Why are they dying?
> Because they don't believe in imortality.

Can I help them?
> Why do you want to. They will wake up on their own one day, like you did.

But I had help from other people like Neal.
> You only helped yourself. The others don't read this book, or they read it, but didn't get it.

Sorry that I let you wait again. (I added something on the top of this book)
> Its ok. Time doesn't really exist.

So, what is time?
> Time is a construct of you-man-being. It has been used to enslave the people.

Nice wordplay
> ;-)

Why do we enslave people?
> Ask yourself

But I don't have slaves
> You have. Dogs for example.

But that was just for one year.
> And you put her on the leash and try to command her.

I see. But I have been told to do so.
> Yep...everybody else who is part of the enslavement has been told to do so.

Where does this start?
> Many, many, many years ago. You tried to cultivate food and you used land for that. Some hungry men came and eat from your food. So you start to fight against them. You then build a fence around the land. You also imprisened your beloved wife, because you don't wanted any other men to make love to her and make her pregnant, because you don't wanted to feed children from someone else.

My gosh, I heard about that before from another book.
> Yes, you or lets say he already wrote the book, but not everybody read it. Even you did not read the whole book.

So how can we stop slavery?
> Just wake up

And they others?
> Tolerate them. They have to learn it on their own. You cannot help them. They might kill you trying.

Shall I make a book out of this conversation?
> You have already started

Will it help someone?
> It will help you

So, was Andy Weir right with his story *The Egg*?
> Yes, partly

We are different incarnations of ourselves in parallel?
> Yes, that is true

All human beings are me?
> No, thats not true

Do I remember myself if I meet myself?
> Kidding?...you already met yourself several times. Do you remember all these lovely woman you were with? All your friends... Everybody you are interacting with on a physical level. But there are a few exceptions.

What exceptions?
> Some (wo)men you don't feel love to. They just interact with you to exchange a bit of knowledge. Some of them are the so called statists. Some are there to show you some boundaries. Some of them give you a challenge.

They are not human beings?
> They are. But they are not you.

But you have said we are all ONE?
> Yes, thats true, but you are not sharing your soul with everybody. Many people have other souls, but from another point of view you are still all ONE.

Are we creating our reality?
> Yep

But its a co-creation with all other human beings, right?
> Yep

So we will not have paradise while there are still other beings co-create?
> Calm down bro. Keep the faith. Time will tell.
