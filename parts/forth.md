# Soul plan

Last time we spoke about the laws and authorities.  
Now I want to ask you about transition.
Who can we start to transform our economy to the better?
> I told you already to get rid of media. Then you have only your own ideas left. You can do whatever **you** want and not what **they** want you to do. You are then able to have a chat with your higher self.

Yes, I know...just doing that.
> So everybody else can do that also. You can then for example ask your higher self for the plan of your soul. Try it out right now.

Ok...what is my soul plan? What is my purpose in life?
> Your purpose in life is to find out what your purpose is.

Haha, very funny.
> What I mean is. Try out some different things. With one thing or the other you might feel more connected than with something else. What do you really like to do?

Hm...I like to have sex.
> Yeah, I understand... How can you give that to the world?

Hm...I already give Tantra Massages, pratice Sexological Bodywork and I am giving workshops for a special tantric massage which I have kinda developed.
> So you are on your way.

Not really...I like to give these treatments but almost nobody is interested in receiving it.
> Have you got a studio where you can offer it?

No yet. I once had a studio on the west coast of Denmark...but only a few people came over to that place. Some people drove more than 100 km.
> Wow, 100 km...than they were more than just interested in your work.

My wife drove about 1.000 km to get a traetment. We are separted since a few years.
> I see. Did she liked it? Of course...so what if you settle somewhere, where you can attract more people? What if you settle somewhere you also can do your hobbies.

Yeah...there is a town in Portugal where I can also do kitesurfing close to. And the houses are very cheap compared to my hometown.
> So, what are you waiting for?

I don't know...
> What else do you like much?

I like to program useful software.
> That's good. You can do this everywhere on this planet even in your studio while waiting for customers, who wants to get a massage.

Yeah...I was already thinking about that. I wanted to create something like that in Luzern already.
> What has distracted you?

My life...I was in a toxic marriage that days. And than I have escaped to Denmark.
> So think also about to create such a place in Luzern. Where is your hometown?

In Hamburg
> Have you thought about creating such a place also in Hamburg?

Yes, but...at that time I was already without money.
> Ah, I see. And you don't know where you might get money from?

Hm, I know how to make money. Was have been a millionare before.
> So what's the point?

I have stepped out of the system.
> Why?

I had a burnout. I don't wanted to work for the banksters anymore.
> Did you knew, that there are also other branches other than banks?

But they do not pay so much.
> Hello EGO

I see. I just have to drop my ego and work also for less money.
> How much money do you have right now?

I have got around 80 to 150,- € a month.
> How much money do you ask creating software for non-banks?

I would ask for 75,- € an hour.
> Do you see it?

Oh my gosh. I just have to work two or three hours a month to get more than I have now. Why am I sooo blind?
> Welcome back brother
