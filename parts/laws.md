# Laws

I was thinking how we could get rid of their laws and rules.
> I told you already their rules are just fiction. If you don't believe in them, then they are not affecting you at all.

But they might imprison me for what ever I do.
> What if you create your own rules and write them down. Share them with friends and let them sign the rules. If you get together a critical mass on people for a new law, then these rules become guilty like their rules. If you find for example 1.000 people that are signing these new rules, then you have got more people sticking to that rules than you have to the governments rules. The government, if they call themselves democratic, will decide for their rules in the parliament. There are only about 300 seats. So at maximum only 300 people decides for a rule. So your own rules have more power.

Wow, what an idea. I have to share this with others.
> Yeah, finish this book. Publish it and advertise for it. Everybody who will read it, might agree with these new rules and will therefore spread the word about this book.

Oh, shall I ask for money to sell this book then?
> Yes, of course. Why not? You are working on it so you deserve an energy exchange.

Shall I put some new possible rules into this book?
> Yeah, make some samples.

How can be sure, that more people will like these new rules?
> First of all. These rules must be for the people and not for the corporations. Then remember the phrase from Michael Tellinger.  
**If it's not good for everyone, than it's not good at all.**

Jep, I remember. This was from the UBUNTU movement from South Africa.
> Exactly

How can we sure or how can we state that there have been many people signing for that rules?
> Have you heard about direct democracy or basic democracy?

Yep, I have been living in Switzerland
> They have direct democracy, but they also have got the media. So the people often vote, what main stream media is telling them.

So how can we do it?
> You are a software developer. Let's create an app for this. Only people who are using this app will know about these rules. So main stream media doesn't know about it and therefore they will not interfere. At least not in the beginning.

How can we get rid of main stream media?
> Don't use it

But they will manipulate other people?
> That doesn't matter at all. When you have got 1.000 people who signed these new rules they are activated. They are parallel to their rules. Try to also get lawyers involved. They will know how to deal with that and can help your small circle. The other people can still have their set of rules and you have yours.
