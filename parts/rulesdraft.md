# Rules Draft

These rules are just a possibility. We might change them so that they fit to everybody.
First we have to repeat human rights as they were stated in the Grundgesetz (kind of constitution) in Germany in the first version.
These human rights should be made non changeable!

Then we should focus on only a few rules. As I have learned when I made my driving license the first rule was:  
**Do not harm anybody.**

This would be already enough, but we can also state some special rules which allows us to do things, which are forbidden in their rules.

For example:  
> It is allowed to drive a car after having a minimum of 10 lessons in driving.

> It is allowed to drive a car without check control when you can state, that the car is healthy to drive without a risk.

> It is allowed to drive a car with your own number-plates which you have to register online with a special service made available for members of ... (maybe an association created by us, which also functions as an insurance. So you only have to pay a membership fee and you get number-plates and insurance. If there is an accident, we might all put our money together to pay the opposition).

> You don't have to pay taxes.

> You cannot be imprisoned by their police.

> The rules of their laws are not relevant for us. ( A lawyer has to write this for us ;-)


## Ending
These are only a few rules. Let us know if there are more ideas from you. But keep in mind. The less rules the easier to remember.
