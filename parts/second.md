# We are all ONE

To be honest I was hoping that we are all one and if I would awake, all others will also awake and we will have paradise on earth again.  

It seems that this was not the case.  

We ended our last talk with the conclusion, that we are not the only one on this planet.
> Exactly, to be precise...all souls on this planet belong to the earth including the trees and the animals.

So we are different souls?
> Yep

Will we leave the planet one day?
> Yes, one day you will become like me, when you are matured.

So, in this Andy Weir was correct in his book *The Egg*?
> Yep, almost everything he wrote was correct. He has just perceive it a little bit different.

Yeah. That doesn't really matter I feel.
> Yep

If we believe in his book, than we already know, that we should not hurt someone else, because we might hit ourself.
> Yeah, that's it.

Is this also the reason, that I am writing this book? That we can help other souls to find their way?
> Yeah

How can we stop violence on earth?
> Tell the truth

But we are living with these lies since thousands of years?
> Good time to start

But then the whole ecosystem will collapse. The governments, the laywers, the judges, big pharma, advertising, televion they all will die out.
> Yeah, its about time

Where should we start then?
> Start to get rid of programming. Give away your television set. Stop to listen radio. Stop to use social media. Get rid of all these stimulation from the outside.

But we need social media to connect to each other.
> What about talking?

But some friends are far away?
> You can talk to each other when you see each other again.

I see. Today I am offline and I have got time to talk to you and to write this book. I was waisting much time online. I was talking to people that I have never seen in personal. Sometimes I thought that these people are artificial.
> Yes. There is also AI involved to create some traffic on these websites.

A friend ask me once if I want to earn some money, chatting in a dating website.
> So you already know it

But that's unfair
> That's why you all should only tell the truth.

When the ecosystem is collapsed how can we survive? Where did we get food from?
> Grow your own food.

And what about houses?
> You already have got enough houses. Maybe you just have to repair some of them.

What about industrial product?
> What would you really miss?

Computers
> For what reason do you need a computer?

To play games, so do social media, to write software, to write books...
> Do you really need that?

In university I have learned, that we only need shelter, food, water and love.
> Thats correct

You mean that's enough?
> Yep. The rest is luxury. But there will still be luxury, but you don't need industry anymore.

I see... I have to think about it, until I will have another question.
Thanks for now.
