# Housing

So what's left?  
What may I ask next?  
What else do we need to have a wonderful life?  

How can we life in the near future. What kind of housing do we really need?  
> Yeah, that depends where you want to live. Is is cold in winter? Is it rainy. Do you need much sun, because it's dark in winter?

Lets assume we are living in Portugal for example.  
> There, if its in the south, you don't need an oven at all. There you don't need insulation. You can build small tiny houses like domes and containers. You could also live in a mobile home and travel south when it's getting colder.

And what to do in Schweden for example?  
> There you can build very sheap log houses with a fireplace. There is much wood to burn in winter and the logs give a good insulation. No need to have a concreate house with expensive insulation.

Is it good to have a concreate floor?  
> No, this will separate you from mother earth. You should walk on the earth or on wood instead.

Do we need electricity and water from the grid?  
> No not at all. If you really need electricity go with solar panels, wind generators or the like. Water you can collect from the rain or you can dig a well or you can look for a source. The nature is telling you where to find a water source. Ask the people who live there how to find a source.
