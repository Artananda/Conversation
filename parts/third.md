# No need to work

So do you really believe that we are able to live without all these products?  
> As I already said. You only need shelter, food, water and love.

Don't we need to work at all?  
> No, not at all. Look at all these animals. Do they work? Look at all the plants. They are growing without the need to work.

But why are these people are all working like 40 hours a day?
> You should ask them.

But how do we buy food? We need money to buy food.
> Do you really need money? Have you ever just grab an apple from a tree?

Yes, but there are almost always fences around these fruit trees.
> So, get rid of the fences then.

But the owner bought the land and that is his right to build a fence.
> Who gave them the right? And why would you buy land at all. The land is free for all.

But they say we have to buy it. It is written in the laws.
> Who made the laws?

They did.
> Who are they?

Authorities
> And? Who gave them the right to do so?

They gave themselves the right. These laws where there before I was born. The king is giving this to his son. And then this son is giving it to his son and so forth.
> And who are these king? Why do you think that they can do that? Are they more worth than you?

They have got the army.
> Now you are close

They send their army also to us to collect taxes.
> Did you agree to that?

They would imprison me, if I do not pay.
> Who is giving them the right to do so?

We all?
> Law is just a fiction. A fiction is only working for those who believe in it.

But we all have to do what they are saying?
> Really?

They send the police or their army after us
> Really?

You mean, we don't have to accept their rules?
> This is up to you.

But I am alone and they are more.
> Do you really think, that you are the only one thinking like this?

I don't know
> That's why you are writing this book. To find out.

How can I be sure that there are others like me?
> Let them send you an email. Or let them send you a message on Telegram.
